## Current objective

Build the token-efficient data layer in shadow mode without changing Arthur's existing analysis logic.

## Active work

Phase 10 complete: configurable structured-output model runner with token metadata.

## Decisions

- API-Football is the primary MVP football provider.
- Odds remain a separate data channel and have 0% weight in football ranking.
- Do not buy the Pro plan until the cached pipeline is ready for a live current-season trial.
- Secrets remain in environment variables and never enter Git.
- Windows installs the `tzdata` package for Europe/Berlin support.

## Next actions

1. Import the exact legacy Arthur prompt as a new immutable prompt version when supplied.
2. Attach prices only after the frozen football ranking and completed Kerekasztal run.
3. Add the preserved deterministic ticket gate.
4. Add settlement and performance telemetry; token counts are already captured per role call.
5. Upgrade API-Football only for the first real current-season shadow run.

## Important rule

This file is the canonical human-readable current state of the project and must be updated after meaningful changes.
